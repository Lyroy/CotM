"These lands shall be ours."
# Midlands
Midlands13 is a low-fantasy HRP server, focused on both characters and an overarching event-driven story. We aim to provide a space for roleplay-inclined players to develop stories, establish persistent relationships with other characters, and have fun doing so.
Using Ratwood as our codebase, we do not aim to replicate their gameplay in any way, but instead build on it to create engaging character customization.
